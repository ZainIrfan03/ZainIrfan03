💫 About Me:
I am a Software Engineering student with hands-on experience in backend development using ADO.NET and SQL. I have a strong interest in building efficient, data-driven applications and writing clean, maintainable code.

Currently, I am learning JavaScript to strengthen my frontend and full-stack development skills. I also enjoy problem-solving using C++, with a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and data structures.

I am actively looking for learning opportunities, guidance, and collaborations with developers and teams where I can enhance my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and grow as a software engineer.
